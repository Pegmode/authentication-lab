1.
The default framework is set using the DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES setting.
2.
HTTP basic auth
3.
Basic auth passwords are not excrypted and the password can't be easily revoked by the user
Token auth can be secured with encyption and can also expire
4.
The user makes a request to an authorization server (who is a 3rd party, google in the example)
The authorization server then gives the user a token that only gives them limited access to resources on another server (resource server,bitbucket in the example)
The user gets limited access to requested information and having the auth token does not result in a total security breach in case the token is stolen
